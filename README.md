/* Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Project Background
The following is an analysis project undertaken based on retail transactional data that encompasses: 
    •	Five (5) countries (USA, Germany, Australia, UK and Canada)
    •	One (1) year worth of data
    •	159,334 customers (ranging from 18-70 years of age; 62% male, 38% female) and
    •	301,010 transactions 

This analysis was conducted by myself individually on the below dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahilprajapati143/retail-analysis-large-dataset/data

This dataset contains numerous data points from: 
    •	customer demographic information (name, email address, country, phone number address, gender etc) to
    •	purchasing information (order quantity and dollar figure totals) through to
    •	product category and transaction information
    Page 3 of this analysis takes the reader through the data structure defined in more depth. 

This large dataset is not without its errors; the pre-uploaded dataset to MySQL had numerous NULL values and blank fields, inconsistencies in column headers as well as errors in the data fields themselves more generally and formatting issues that I have addressed with the use of Excel and MySQL query functionalities to correct and standardise. 

The project was planned in two (2) key phases:
    1.	Data Cleaning: 
        -	Conducted various cleaning and standardisation tasks in Excel and SQL (more detail on page 4) to ensure the best possible accuracy, authenticity and reliability of the analysis, in order to best practically 
            apply its insights.  
    
    2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        This phase uses specific SQL Queries and Tableau visualisation techniques to take a deeper dive into what insights can be gleaned from the data in alignment with business metrics from a sales, customer and product 
        standpoint (more detail page 6). 
        The intention is to provide sales professionals/managers and/or employees operating within a retail context, actionable recommendations that they can use to focus their efforts to be more profitable.
        The analysis is intentionally focussed on these retail industry metrics/key areas of interest:

Sales Performance Insights
    -	What are the top revenue generating products?
    -	Which countries have the highest numbers of purchases?
    -	What is the average order value (AOV)?
    -	What is the average order quantity?

Customer Insights 
    -	Do customers follow a particular: gender, age and/or income pattern or trend?
    -	What is the percentage split of customers by gender, income level?
    -	What about the average age of customers?
    -	How much revenue is driven by repeat vs one-off/new customers? 
  
Product (Market) Trends
    -	Which products are underperforming? 
    -	Which product categories are performing? and which are not?
    -	Are there particular brands performing better/worse than others?
