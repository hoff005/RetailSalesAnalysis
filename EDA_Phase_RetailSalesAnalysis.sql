 I will be analysing this data to uncover the below insights: 
   
   Sales Performance
   - Which products or services are generating the most revenue?
   - How many products in total were sold in 2023 vs 2024? Year on year (YOY) comparison
   - What is the average order value (AOV)? 
   
   Customer Insights 
   - What is the customer retention rate?
   - Do top spending customers follow a particular: gender, age and/or income pattern?
   - How much revenue is driven by repeat vs new customers? 
   
   Product (Market) Trends
   - Which products are underperforming? 
   - Which product categories are performing? and which are not?
   - Are there particular brands performing better/worse than others?

	Are there any more notable trends in general prevailing throughout the data?
